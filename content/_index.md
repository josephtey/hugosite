### How to Build a Cloud-Native Full-Stack Web Application **using AWS Amplify**

Welcome! 

This is a beginner workshop targetted at University students who are new to **Amazon Web Services**. The main question we seek to answer by the end of this workshop is:

**How can I use AWS to enhance my own personal projects?**

To answer this question, we will focus on using AWS to supercharge web development, specifically by:

1. Explaining the benefits of using AWS to build web applications.
2. Providing a high-level overview of key AWS services, including Lambda, S3, Cognito, API gateway, etc.
3. Using AWS Amplify to seamlessly connect a range of AWS services to produce a fullstack, serverless web application.

We hope that by the end of this workshop, you will not only be confident using AWS in your own projects, but you will realise the vast range of possibilities the AWS has to offer.
